# SineGraph
A simple app who shows an animated sine graph based in the user input.

After opening the index.html in your browser, you'll have the choice to input a sine function and see it's graph.

The default function is "sin(x + an) * x". ("an" stands to "animation", if you get rid of that, the animation will stop).
